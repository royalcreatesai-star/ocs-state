# Project Reconciliation — Gate 5
**Program:** O'Connor Configured System (OCS) | ROC-OS
**Doc Ref:** DOC_2026-06-14_AI_PROJECTS_GATE5-RECONCILIATION_V1
**Date:** 2026-06-14
**Author:** Royal O'Connor + Claude (Opus 4.8)
**Purpose:** Account for every "project" across every source. Define the taxonomy, count by source, deduplicate to a true total, flag discrepancies, recommend cleanup.
**Model decision (locked):** LAYERED. `blueprint/projects.md` stays the all-engine master. `OAIS_STATE` stays the AI-asset consolidation view. This report is the BRIDGE between them — it changes neither, it reconciles both.

---

## 0. WHY THE EARLIER PASSES MISSED THINGS

The word **"project" is overloaded across 6 sources + 2 state lineages + 3 conceptual layers**, none of which agreed. OAIS_STATE only ever captured one slice. There was never a single map of the whole territory — until this document.

---

## 1. SOURCE TAXONOMY

### 1A. The "project" sources (where actual projects live)

| # | Source | Platform | Location | File API? |
|---|--------|----------|----------|-----------|
| S1 | **Claude.ai Projects** | Anthropic | claude.ai (cloud) | ❌ None — manual list only |
| S2 | **OpenAI Custom GPTs** | OpenAI | ChatGPT (cloud) | ❌ Export-to-Drive only |
| S3 | **OpenAI Projects** | OpenAI | ChatGPT (cloud) | ❌ Manual paste only |
| S4 | **iCloud PROJ_* folders** | Local | `/ME/Ai/PROJ_*` | ✅ Full |
| S5 | **blueprint/projects/*.md** | Local + Drive mirror | `/ME/Ai/blueprint/projects/` + Drive `1CVa…` | ✅ Full |
| S6 | **Drive PROJECT_STATE exports** | Drive | Drive folder `1t0_…` | ✅ Full |

### 1B. The state-file lineages (the "drop this first" docs — should be ONE, are TWO)

| Lineage | Title | Latest | Gate progress | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|---------------|--------|
| L1 | `OAIS_STATE` (O'Connor AI System State) | V5 | Gate 4 CLOSED / Gate 5 OPEN | ✅ Newer — canonical |
| L2 | `OCS_Program_State` (PROJECT_STATE.md — OCS Program) | V5 | Gate 3 IN PROGRESS | ⚠ Older content, SAME "V5" label, same date |

Plus a third inventory doc referenced by L2: **`Asset_Registry_V1/V2.md`** (12 projects + 11 embedded harness assets).

### 1C. Conceptual layers (NOT projects — these kept inflating the count)

| Layer | What it is | Why it's not a project |
|-------|-----------|------------------------|
| **North Star / Blueprint** | Five-engine income strategy | Master strategy that SITS ABOVE all projects |
| **The Binder** | 8-chapter client deliverable (Gate 7) | A product/output, not a workstream. **NOT the Audit Trainer.** |
| **OCS / ROC-OS** | The 60-day program itself | The container, not a project within it |
| **The Playbook** | Sellable methodology | A deliverable derived from the program |

## 4. AGGREGATE TOTALS

### By representation (raw sum across sources)
| Source | Raw count |
|--------|-----------|
| S1 Claude Projects (original) | 11 |
| S2 OpenAI GPTs | 6 |
| S3 OpenAI Projects | 2 ⚠ |
| S4 iCloud PROJ_* | 5 |
| S5 blueprint/projects/*.md | 12 |
| S6 Drive PROJECT_STATE | 10 |
| **Raw total (with duplicates)** | **46** |

### Deduplicated — the TRUE count
| Category | Unique count |
|----------|-------------|
| **Distinct active initiatives** (table §3) | **24** |
| of which: cross-platform pairs | 2 (Translator, Travel) |
| of which: Cold Case ecosystem | 5 (1 Claude + 4 GPT) |
| Conceptual layers (NOT projects) | 4 (North Star, Binder, OCS, Playbook) |
| Data artifacts (NOT projects) | 1 (Property tax/expense schedules) |
| Excluded (Anthropic sample) | 1 (How to use Claude) |

> **Composition correction (post-confirmation 2026-06-14):** Count held at 24 after two offsetting fixes — (+1) McKayla's Study Partner and Spark Tween Mentor are SEPARATE initiatives (one per child); (−1) "Property Management | Tax Schedules" reclassified as a data artifact, not a project. OpenAI Projects confirmed complete at 2. Commercial Broker confirmed Claude-only.

**🎯 BOTTOM LINE: 24 unique initiatives across 5 engines + personal/family. Everything else is the same work represented in multiple places.**

### By engine
| Engine | Initiatives |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 — W2 | (Cold Case shared 1/2) |
| 2 — O'Connor Advisory | Cash Flow Master, Translator, AI Bootcamp, Cold Case |
| 3 — Real Estate | Commercial Broker, REI Tech Expert, Property Mgmt/Tax, Bay St, SI REI, Property Fin Tracking |
| 4 — AI Product | WallyB, MovieWatch, Custom GPTs, Family Sports |
| 5 — Investing | Financial Strategist, AI Thought Leader, The Playbook, Auto-Trading |
| Personal/Family | Travel, Home Renovation, Spark/McKayla |

## 5. DISCREPANCY LOG

| ID | Discrepancy | Severity | Resolution |
|----|-------------|----------|------------|
| D1 | **Two state lineages** (OAIS_STATE vs OCS_Program_State). NOT an accidental desync — intentionally different: OCS_Program_State = Claude-env / OCS-foundation detail; OAIS_STATE = cross-platform bridge. | 🔴 HIGH | ✅ **DECIDED:** consolidate to OAIS_STATE as the single canonical. Fold OCS_Program_State's OCS-foundation content (16 harness assets, Refinery, NotebookLM MCP) into OAIS_STATE, then retire that lineage. Saved to memory. |
| D2 | **Three inventories disagree** (OAIS §6 = 12, blueprint/projects.md ≈ 25 line items, Asset_Registry = 12) | 🟡 MED | ✅ Layered model: blueprint = master, OAIS = AI subset, this report = bridge. |
| D3 | **Cross-platform pairs** (Translator, Travel) counted as separate projects | 🟡 MED | ✅ Tracked as 1 initiative / 2 instances in §3. |
| D4 | **Spark vs McKayla's Study Partner** | 🟡 MED | ✅ **RESOLVED: SEPARATE.** McKayla's Study Partner = SHSAT/TACHS/ISEE (McKayla). Spark = Tween Mentor, Elementary (younger child). One per child. |
| D5 | **Property Management \| Tax Schedules** | 🟡 MED | ✅ **RESOLVED: DATA artifact, not a project.** Property tax/expense spreadsheets in iCloud `.numbers` + Drive `.xlsx`. ⚠ Steuben `.xlsx` missing from Drive. |
| D6 | **Commercial Broker** — also an OpenAI GPT? | 🟢 LOW | ✅ **RESOLVED: Claude only.** |
| D7 | **Naming mismatch** across sources (e.g. `PROJ_AI_REI` / `RE_PROPDATA` / `REI Technical Expert`) | 🟡 MED | → CoWork: homogenize per naming bundle `{TYPE}_{DATE}_{DOMAIN}_{CATEGORY}_{DESCRIPTION}_{VERSION}`; one code per initiative. |
| D8 | **OpenAI Projects completeness** | 🟡 MED | ✅ **RESOLVED: complete at 2** (no others worth noting). |
| D9 | **Duplicate "Project MD files (Various Sources)"** Google Doc in Drive root | 🟢 LOW | ✅ Confirmed discard. Safe to delete. |
| D10 | **iCloud ↔ Drive redundancy** — iCloud was original storage; mostly duplicates Drive (project folders, blueprint, WallyB) | 🟡 MED | → CoWork: dedup both sides where appropriate. iCloud is origin; Drive is canonical hallway. |

---

## 6. RECOMMENDATIONS (consolidation actions)

1. **Resolve D1 now** — declare `OAIS_STATE` the single canonical state file. Fold any unique content from `OCS_Program_State_V5` (16 harness assets, Refinery, NotebookLM MCP details) into OAIS_STATE, then archive the OCS_Program_State lineage.
2. **Adopt one code per initiative** — `PROJ_{ENGINE}_{NAME}` everywhere (iCloud folder, Drive state, OAIS registry).
3. **Mark cross-platform pairs explicitly** in the registry (Translator, Travel) so dedup stays honest.
4. **Confirm the 4 ⚠ items** (D4, D5, D6, D8) to lock the true count between 24 and ~26.
5. **Keep blueprint/projects.md as master** per layered decision; OAIS §6 points to it.

### CoWork cleanup handoff (both sides — Drive + iCloud)
- **Naming homogenization** — rename legacy files (`wallyb.md`, `OAIS_STATE_V5.md`, `PROJECT_STATE_*`, blueprint mirrors) to `{TYPE}_{DATE}_{DOMAIN}_{CATEGORY}_{DESCRIPTION}_{VERSION}` per the naming bundle (`/ME/Ai/DOC_AI_NAMING_BUNDLE/` — has cheat sheet, shell script, PowerShell, iOS shortcut). Decide whether the canonical bridge keeps a stable memorable name (`OAIS_STATE`) as an allowed exception.
- **iCloud ↔ Drive dedup** — iCloud is origin storage and largely duplicates Drive (project folders, blueprint, WallyB). Reduce redundancy where appropriate; keep Drive as canonical hallway.
- **Format gap** — create Steuben `.xlsx` in Drive to match Oxford/Neckar (currently `.numbers` in iCloud only).
- **Retire OCS_Program_State lineage** after folding its content into OAIS_STATE (D1).

## 7. OAIS_STATE UPDATES REQUIRED

- [ ] Add this report to Gate 4/5 deliverables list
- [ ] Section 6: annotate the 12 with cross-platform-pair flags + add S3 OpenAI Projects
- [ ] Add a new "Project Taxonomy & Sources" pointer to this doc
- [ ] Record D1 (V5 lineage collision) as a new Open Finding
- [ ] Note: Audit Trainer ≠ The Binder (confirmed against OCS_Program_State decision #2)
